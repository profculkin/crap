		<p>Make certain that the objects in your design have a lot of contrast.You want the contrast to help make your meaning clear. In the good example, the word big is defined by its large font size, the font weight is also bold, and there is a lot of contrast between the word and the background color. The word small is shown in a small font size that is also light-weight.</p>

		<p>In the bad example, both words are the same size, weight and there is very little contrast between the value of the word and the value of the background.</p>
